# Hedgie Haven
Hedgie Haven Project is my BSc final project that provides extra anonymity for users interested in ananymous web browsing, without waiting for TOR network connection or it's bridging process, by hiding their IP from DNS server by either removing IP after each active session or hashing the IP stored in DNS.
